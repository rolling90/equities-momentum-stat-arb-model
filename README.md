The strategy generates momentum long/short trade entry signals for single name equities, validated by autocorrelation and market regime "risk on/off" indicators.

Purpose:
- To further my career opportunities through upskilling.
- To demonstrate personal progress in python coding proficiency in a quant finance (buy-side) context.
- No python knowledge before 9 June 2025. Today 28 September 2025. 16 weeks of learning.

Methodology:
- download and clean data for an equity index and its constituents
- calculate momentum signal for each ticker
- calculate autocorrelation for each ticker
- calculate market regime as "risk on/off" using a compsite of risk regime indicators
- execute trade entry if the momentum signal is validated by both autocorrelation (persistence in the ticker's price history) and the market regime
- scale positions by contribution to portfolio VaR budget
- optimse for portfolio VaR limit
- execute stratey for optimised portfolio VaR limit
- display performance chart (returns) and summary data (returns, sharpe, mad DD, etc)
