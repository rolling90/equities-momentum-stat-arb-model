Purpose:

- To demonstrate personal progress in python coding proficiency in a quant finance (buy-side) context.
- No python knowledge before 9 June 2025. Today 28 September 2025. 16 weeks of learning.

Methodology:
- download data for an equity index and its constituents
- clean data
- calculate momentum signal

- calculate market regime as "risk on/off" using a compsite of risk regime indicators
- execute trade entry if the momentum signal is validated by both autocorrelation (persistence) and the market regime
- define performance calculation and presentation functions
- scale positions by rolling volatility
- optimse for portfolio VaR limit
- execute stratey for optimised portfolio VaR limit
- display performance chart (returns) and summary data (returns, sharpe, mad DD, etc)
